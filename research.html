<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Proceed: </i>So my project has been verified to focus on medical bottle imagination and manipulation. Methods are: Text recognition with CNN, label understanding with NLP, color justification with camera and image processing, robot imagination with 3D point cloud, etc.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Proceed: </i>First of all I plan to familiarize with our manipulator. Beginning with the text recognition on curved plane, I can understand our manipulator, camera, and CNN. Wish I can make it ASAP.</p>
