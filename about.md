I am currently a Ph.D student in the National University of Singapore(NUS) and also a research engineer under Prof. CHIRIKJIAN, Gregory S.
In June 2021, I finished my master in Mechanical from NUS. My master research title is Tele-rehabilitation Assistant Vision System. Before that, I started my academic career in mechanical engineering, with a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Dalian University of Technology. I spent some time working on mechanical-related topics like design of reducer, development of flexible wearable devices, modeling of soft robots, vision-based detection, etc and I am currently working on robot manipulation based on vision and natural language processing methods. I like learning about innovations in machine learning, natural language volleyball, and improv comedy.
