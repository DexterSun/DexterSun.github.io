<br>

I am currently finishing my PhD in Economics from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley. I've spent some time working with central banks through an 8 month visit in Germany at the Deutsche Bundesbank and with a current research project with the Banco de la Rep&uacute;blica in Colombia. I've done internships in the credit department of Moody's Analytics and in various financial companies, including investment funds. Outside of economics and finance, I like learning about natural language processing and neat ways of modelling text, improving my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and spending time with friends and family.
